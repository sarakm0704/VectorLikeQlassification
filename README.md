# VectorLikeQlassification
event classification using nn for VLQ example

Step:

1. preprocessing
ntuple will be provided. Convert root file into hdf format

2. training
Train NN : you can even try different network: (shallow) DNN / RNN / CNN

3. evaluation
Evaluation using different dataset that are not used for training

4. performance
Compare the performance by drawing ROC curve

5. recurrent feedback for optimization
which structure / input feature / parameter is imporving performance?
